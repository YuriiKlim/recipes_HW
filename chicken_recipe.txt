Ingredients
Kosher salt
1  box (16 oz) rigatoni
2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite size pieces
1/2 medium onion, chopped
2 large bell peppers, chopped
3/4 hot or sweet pickled peppers, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, optional
1/2 c. dry white wine
2 c. tomato puree or sauce
Freshly ground black pepper
1 c. freshly grated parmesan, plus more for garnish
Fresh basil, chopped, for garnish

Directions

Step 1
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt. Add pasta and cook until just al dente, between 5-7 minutes. Drain, but reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water. Set aside pasta and reserved pasta water.
Step 2
In a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, add the oil and heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add chicken in 1 layer and cook until browned on all sides, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.
Step 3
Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in hot (or sweet) peppers and bell peppers, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes more. Add garlic and chili flakes (if using), and cook until just fragrant, about 1 minute.
Step 4
Pour in the white wine, and deglaze the pan by scraping up any browned bits. Allow to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomato puree, and stir until everything is combined. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for about 7 minutes.
Step 5
Add the chicken to the pan and allow to cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the Parmesan and allow it to melt into the sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 6
Add the pasta and Â½ cup of pasta water to the pan. Stir until the sauce is cohesive, adding more pasta water as needed to loosen the sauce. Simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the pasta has reached the texture you desire.
Step 7
Serve in bowls, and garnish with more cheese and basil.
